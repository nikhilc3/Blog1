    "Observations: - In a program, a variable is an abstraction that retains a value. Each variable is paired with data storage that can only hold one value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values).\n",
    "Variables can be thought of as \"containers,\" and each one has a name that describes what it is meant to hold.\n",
    "- Depending on what is being represented, variables have a variety of data types that hold particular types of data."

    "## Hacks 1\n",
    "Questions (College Board's Essential Knowledge):\n",
    "1. What exactly IS a variable?\n",
    "- A variable is an abstraction that stores a value inside of a program, and each variable has a corresponding data storage that holds just one value at a time\n",
    "2. What is the best data type to represent someone's dog's name?\n",
    "   - The best data type is a string\n",
    "3. Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values?\n",
    "   - In order for them to have a name that is appropriate for the value that will be contained.\n",
    "4. What is the best way to represent someone's phone number?\n",
    "   - The best way to ensure that the numbers don't obstruct the code is to use a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus (Not required but important to know): \n",
    "1. How can we update a variable's value\n",
    "   - To update a variable's value u can do it using + or - for incrementing or decrementing\n",
    "2. What function is used to receive a user's input?\n",
    "   - input()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks 2\n",
    "Answer these:\n",
    "1. In your **own** words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is\n",
    "   - The equal sign (=) serves as the assignment operator and enables the assignment of code elements to values.\n",
    "2. In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?\n",
    "   - <--\n",
    "3. A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?\n",
    "   - It would display 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks 3\n",
    "1. What is a list?\n",
    "   - a series of elements, each of which is a variable.\n",
    "2. What is an element\n",
    "   - An element are the items inside of a list.\n",
    "3. What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string?\n",
    "   - using print()\n",
    "4. What is an example of a string?\n",
    "   - Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a list with indices \n",
    "* Index a part of the list that you created.\n",
    "* Try to index from the end"
