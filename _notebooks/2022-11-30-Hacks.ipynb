    "Questions (College Board's Essential Knowledge):\n",
    "1. What exactly IS a variable?\n",
    "- A variable is an abstraction that stores a value inside of a program, and each variable has a corresponding data storage that holds just one value at a time\n",
    "2. What is the best data type to represent someone's dog's name?\n",
    "   - The best data type is a string\n",
    "3. Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values?\n",
    "   - In order for them to have a name that is appropriate for the value that will be contained.\n",
    "4. What is the best way to represent someone's phone number?\n",
    "   - The best way to ensure that the numbers don't obstruct the code is to use a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus (Not required but important to know): \n",
    "1. How can we update a variable's value\n",
    "   - To update a variable's value u can do it using + or - for incrementing or decrementing\n",
    "2. What function is used to receive a user's input?\n",
    "   - input()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks 2\n",
    "Answer these:\n",
    "1. In your **own** words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is\n",
    "   - The equal sign (=) serves as the assignment operator and enables the assignment of code elements to values.\n",
    "2. In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?\n",
    "   - <--\n",
    "3. A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?\n",
    "   - It would display 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks 3\n",
    "1. What is a list?\n",
    "   - a series of elements, each of which is a variable.\n",
    "2. What is an element\n",
    "   - An element are the items inside of a list.\n",
    "3. What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string?\n",
    "   - using print()\n",
    "4. What is an example of a string?\n",
    "   - Hello World\n",

    "* Create a list with indices \n",

    "First, create algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlining an algorithm's procedure before coding is a smart idea. This guarantees that it is correctly sequenced. You should use a flowchart or simple language to represent the algorithm. You can use visualization to more clearly observe how the entire algorithm works. This might make the coding process more productive and efficient.\n",
