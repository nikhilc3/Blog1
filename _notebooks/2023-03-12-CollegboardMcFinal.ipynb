To remove the last 2 characters of oldString, the substring ends at the position that is 4 characters less than the length of oldString (since 4 characters are removed). The first statement removes the first 2 characters of oldString and assigns the result to tempString. The second statement removes the last 2 characters of tempString and assigns the result to newString. So answer is A and C. \n",

    "Reflection: Answer is A and D The number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n^2. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at a linear rate, as the number of steps is equal to 10n for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time."
