</h2>
<p>My grade and the one given by the college board diverge in a few ways. I thought mine was a little tougher. time an enquiry requests a description or a section of code. When I looked at the question, I would not see anything. Though it's possible that the student clarified it somewhere in their response. In addition, I wasn't quite certain of the locations of sequencing, selection, and iteration. I tried to locate it, but I was compelled to infer it from the movie. I believe that my grade is comparable to the ratings that the College Board assigned the model projects. I am fully aware of the conditions and requirements needed for my project to be successful. To meet all the criteria, my project must be finished, have a wide range of features, and be abstract. Most of the concepts, I believe, were understood by me, however I did have some questions about the identification of lists and parameters. Although it can be challenging to tell them apart at times, overall I feel like I gained a lot of new stuff.</p>
