Data Sorts: Various types of information that can be kept in variables, including numbers, texts, booleans, and objects. . x = &quot;hello world&quot; print(x) . hello world . The term &quot;assignment operators&quot; refers to operators that are used to give a variable a value. . four = 4 print(four) . 4 . Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, and Class: Methods for structuring data in a more complicated manner. Managing Complexity using Variables. . MyList = [1,2,3,4,5] print(MyList) . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Algorithms: A list of guidelines for resolving issues. . An example of a sorting algorithm would be to locate the greatest integer in a list. . Three different forms of control flow structures exist in programming: sequence, selection, and iteration. . Truth, Boolean Expressions and Selection, Comparison Operators, Boolean Expressions, and Iteration Tables: Values are evaluated using expressions, and values are compared using comparison operators. Example: True if (5 &gt; 3) . Upper, Lower, Concatenation, Length, Characters, Strings, and Traversing Concatenation is the act of joining strings together. Upper and lower are functions for changing the case of characters. Traversing strings is the act of iterating over each character in a string. Characters are individual letters, digits, and symbols. Strings are combinations of characters. Example: &quot;Hello World&quot; is a string. 11 length &quot;HELLO WORLD,&quot; in uppercase. . Nested Selection Statements and Python&#39;s If, Elif, and Else conditionals are control statements that let you run code based on certain circumstances. Example: if (x &gt; 0) print (&quot;x is greater than 0&quot;) if x equals 0, print (&quot;x is equal to 0&quot;) if not: print (&quot;x is less than 0&quot;) . Python&#39;s For and While loops with Range and List allow you to iterate through a list of items or a range of numbers. Example: For x in the (0, 10) range: print(x) . Combining conditionals and loops to achieve Break, Continue Control statements that let you skip an iteration or exit a loop. For instance, if x &gt; 10: Break x += 1 if x == 5 . Procedure Abstraction: A method for making complicated jobs simpler by dividing them into smaller, more manageable tasks. . Python definition procedures are a way to specify a set of instructions that will be carried out when a specific procedure is invoked. . Arguments provided to a procedure when it is invoked are known as parameters. . Return Values: A value that is given back following the completion of an operation. . Selection: Based on particular conditions, the execution of specific code is permitted by the selection type of control flow. . Lists are data structures that enable the storage of numerous values in a single variable. . Iteration: This sort of control flow enables the repeated execution of a piece of code. . A logical operator is a sort of operator used in computer science that conducts a logical operation on two or more values or variables, such as a comparison or boolean operation. The logical operators AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and NAND are a few examples. .",

Each variable is paired with data storage that can only hold one value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). Variables can be thought of as &quot;containers,&quot; and each one has a name that describes what it is meant to hold. . Depending on what is being represented, variables have a variety of data types that hold particular types of data. | . Hacks 1 . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | A variable is an abstraction that stores a value inside of a program, and each variable has a corresponding data storage that holds just one value at a time | . What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? The best data type is a string | . | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? In order for them to have a name that is appropriate for the value that will be contained. | . | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? The best way to ensure that the numbers don&#39;t obstruct the code is to use a string. | . | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable&#39;s value To update a variable&#39;s value u can do it using + or - for incrementing or decrementing | . | What function is used to receive a user&#39;s input? input() | . | Hacks 2 . Answer these: . In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is The equal sign (=) serves as the assignment operator and enables the assignment of code elements to values. | . | In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? &lt;-- | . | A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? It would display 22. | . | Hacks 3 .

Notes: An algorithm is a sequential process that describes a set of instructions that must be followed in a specific order in order to produce the intended result. An algorithm provides the computer with a set of instructions that it can follow to complete any task. There are three components to an algorithm: sequencing, selection, and iteration. Similar to how you would follow a teacher&#39;s instructions, a sequence is the order in which something should be done in order to accomplish a goal. A loop, or iteration, occurs when something is repeated until a condition is met, such when you turn off your computer after finishing a task. Languages that utilize arithmetic operators include those that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. . Hacks 1 . Sequencing: 1,2,5 Selection: 3 Iteration: 4 . Hacks 2 . num1 = 5 num2 = num1 * 3 num3 = num2 / num1 * (9 % 2) * 4 result = (num3 % num1 + num2) % num3 * 3 / 5 print(result) . 3.0 . Crossword Puzzle . Down: 1) iteration 2) selection . Across: 3) sequence . Lesson 5-6 Hacks . Explain in your own words what each logical operator does. . Not: This displays the opposite of the data inputed. | And: This helps determine if the conditions are met | Or: This may help determine if one of the conditions is met. | . Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator . walking = True result = not(walking) print(result) . False . USD = 10 Coins = 100 if USD &gt;= 9 and Coins &gt;= 100: print(&quot;You have a lot of money&quot;) else: print(&quot;you have less money&quot;) . You have a lot of money . Cars = 100 Ferrari = 2 if Ferrari &gt;= 1 or Cars &gt;= 101: print(&quot;you have good cars&quot;) . you have good cars . 1 point for defining all the key terms in your own words. 0.5 points if you use examples that show you truly understand it. . Selection: This is a piece of code that is determined if the ouput is true or false. | Algorithm: An algorithm is a process and a set of rules that should be followed when doing calculations. | Conditional statements: These are a set of rules to see if a condition is met. | . 1 point for writing a program that uses binary conditional logic. 0.5 points if it is original and shows complexity . x = int(input(&quot;choose a number&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(x, &quot;is even&quot;) else: print(x, &quot;is odd&quot;) . 12 is even . Lesson 9 and 11 Hacks . Notes . First, create algorithms. . Outlining an algorithm&#39;s procedure before coding is a smart idea. This guarantees that it is correctly sequenced. You should use a flowchart or simple language to represent the algorithm. You can use visualization to more clearly observe how the entire algorithm works. This might make the coding process more productive and efficient. . 2) Evaluation of Iteration and Selection . Iterative algorithms repeat a function until a target is reached. We can use iteration to more simply represent an algorithm without illustrating all the repeated steps. Algorithms with selection only execute specific functions in the case of certain conditions being true or false. . 3) Why are algorithms used? . It is simple to think that two algorithms that look quite similar do the same task. That is not the case, though, because we have learned to detect minute variations in code and essentially debug. . isCold = True isHot = False if isCold == True: print(&quot; Jacket necessary!&quot;) elif isHot == True: print(&quot;No Jacket necessary!&quot;) . Jacket necessary! . isCold = False isHot = True puddles = not(isCold) and isHot if isHot == False: print(&quot;No Jacket!&quot;) elif isCold == True: print(&quot;Jacket!&quot;) . 1) When the code first runs, there are 5 coins available. . 2) The AmountMoney variable is set to True. . 3) $1 is subtracted from the coins variable but AmountMoney stays true. . 4) The string &quot;Broke!&quot; is printed when the variable coins reaches a value of 0. At that point, AmountMoney is set to False. . 5) End! . Coins = 10 AmountMoney = True while(AmountMoney == True): Coins -= 1 if Coins == 0: AmountMoney == False print(&quot;Broke&quot;) break . Broke . import random num_guesses = 0 user_guess = -1 upper_bound = 100 lower_bound = 0 number = random.randint(0,100) print(f&quot;I&#39;m thinking of a number between 0 and 100.&quot;) def guess(): num = input(&quot;Input your guess&quot;) return num def search(number, guess): global lower_bound, upper_bound if int(guess) &lt; int(number): print(&quot;Too low, try again!!!!&quot;) lower_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound elif int(guess) &gt; int(number): print(&quot;Too high, try again!!!!! &quot;) upper_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound else: upper_bound, lower_bound = guess, guess return lower_bound, upper_bound while user_guess != number: user_guess = guess() num_guesses += 1 print(f&quot;You guessed {user_guess}.&quot;) lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess) if int(upper_bound) == int(number): break else: print(f&quot;Guess a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.&quot;) print(f&quot;You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!&quot;) .

Lesson 12-13 hacks . a) Procedure: A block of code that is created to perform a given task - essentially a function. . b) Parameter: A variable that is utilized in a function that enables data to be imported into said function. . a) A return value is a value that a function or method returns to the caller code once it has completed executing. Once the function or method has completed its task, the value is returned to the caller code. . b) Output parameters, which are variables supplied by reference to a function or method and used to return a value to the caller code, are another type of parameter. They are frequently used to have a single function or method return a number of values. . import math userNum = float(input()) def sqrt(userNum): return userNum sqrt = math.sqrt(userNum) print(&quot;Square root of&quot;, userNum , &quot;:&quot;, float(sqrt)) .

Collatz One of the most well-known unsolved mathematical puzzles is the Collatz conjecture. The conjecture asks if every positive integer will eventually become 1 if two basic arithmetic processes are repeated. . Hailstone digits Hailstone Numbers are the series of integers produced by the Collatz conjecture. Examples: N = 7 as an input Output: Hailstone 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 5, 16, 8, 4, and 1 are the numbers. ### Iteration The act or process of iterating or repeating: for example, a process where the repetition of a series of actions produces outcomes that get progressively closer to the desired outcome. . Unsolvable issues An undecidable problem is one that should have a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response, but for which there is no method that can provide an accurate response for all inputs. . Intractable issues A issue is considered intractable if there is no known algorithm that can be created to solve it. . Extra research: . The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3x + 1 problem or the Syracuse Problem, is an unsolved problem in mathematics. It is a conjecture that states that for any positive integer, if you apply a certain process, you will eventually reach the number 1. The process involves taking any positive integer and, if it is even, dividing it by 2, and if it is odd, multiplying it by 3 and then adding 1. This process is then repeated on the resulting number, and the process is repeated until the number 1 is reached. . This conjecture has been studied extensively and has been proven to be true for all numbers up to 5 × 1018. However, the conjecture has not been proven for all numbers, and it is possible that it is false. This conjecture has been studied since the 1930s and is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. .

Efficiency is properly demonstrated by Algorithm 1, which appends the list and makes use of a for loop to present the data for the specified car in a logical sequence. Because the data is only displayed in the input order, Algorithm 2 is inefficient. Algorithm efficiency in computer science is the measure of how well a particular algorithm performs when compared to other algorithms. It is typically calculated by measuring the amount of time and space it takes to complete a task. . import datetime #Creating a dictionary that stores tasks and their respective times daily_tasks = { &quot;Wake Up&quot; : &quot;6:00 am&quot;, &quot;Breakfast&quot; : &quot;7:00 am&quot;, &quot;Go to Work&quot; : &quot;8:00 am&quot;, &quot;Lunch&quot; : &quot;12:00 pm&quot;, &quot;Work&quot; : &quot;1:00 pm&quot;, &quot;Gym&quot; : &quot;4:00 pm&quot;, &quot;Dinner&quot; : &quot;7:00 pm&quot;, &quot;Sleep&quot; : &quot;10:00 pm&quot; } #Getting the current time current_time = datetime.datetime.now() #Printing the current time print(&quot;Current Time:&quot;, current_time.strftime(&quot;%H:%M %p&quot;)) #Looping through the dictionary for task, time in daily_tasks.items(): #Getting the time in datetime object task_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(time, &quot;%H:%M %p&quot;) #Checking if the task has been completed if task_time &lt; current_time: print(&quot;Task&quot;, task, &quot;has been completed&quot;) else: print(&quot;Task&quot;, task, &quot;is yet to be completed&quot;) .

Your randomly generated password is: wKts6opxiXmquYazB&amp;^e Very strong password . This code generates a random password of a specified length and then checks how strong the password is based on its length. . The first line imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers and selecting random elements from a list. . The chars string contains a list of all the characters that will be used to generate the password. This includes lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. . The code then asks the user to enter the desired length of the password using the input function. This value is converted to an integer using the int function and stored in the length variable. . The random.sample function is used to select length random characters from the chars string, and these characters are joined together using the join method of the string object to form the random password. This password is then printed to the screen. . Finally, the code uses an if statement to check the length of the password and print a message indicating how strong the password is. If the password is longer than 15 characters, it is considered a very strong password. If it is between 9 and 15 characters long, it is considered a strong password. If it is between 5 and 9 characters long, it is considered a decently strong password. Otherwise, it is considered a weak password. .

(&#39;john.doe&#39;, &#39;gmail.com&#39;) . This email slicer uses the built-in split method to split the email address at the &#39;@&#39; character, and returns a tuple containing the username and domain name. .

The AddressBook class has four methods: create_contact, edit_contact, delete_contact, and get_contacts. . The init method initializes an empty dictionary called contacts to store the contact details. . The create_contact method takes three arguments: name, phone, and email, and adds a new contact to the contacts dictionary with these details. The contact&#39;s name is used as the key, and the phone and email are stored as a dictionary value. . The edit_contact method takes three optional arguments: name, phone, and email. It checks if the contact with the specified name exists in the contacts dictionary, and if it does, it updates the phone and/or email if provided. If the contact does not exist, it returns False. . The delete_contact method takes a single argument: name, and removes the contact with the specified name from the contacts dictionary if it exists. If the contact does not exist, it returns False. . The get_contacts method returns a copy of the contacts dictionary. . To use the AddressBook class, you can create a new instance of the class and call the various methods to create, edit, delete, and retrieve contacts. . My own research I do. . pip install yfinance .

My project needs to be comprehensive, with a wide range of features and layers of abstraction, in order to ensure that it satisfies all the requirements. Additionally, I learned how crucial it is to maintain organization when working on it. When a project doesn&#39;t match the requirements in one area, it may be because the creator wasn&#39;t very clear in explaining how it functions. I&#39;ll make sure to clearly explain how my proposal complies with the requirements. .",

For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description | : | :-: seed() | Initialize the random number generator getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range randint() | Returns a random number between the given range choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . For recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur .

Notes: An algorithm is a sequential process that describes a set of instructions that must be followed in a specific order in order to produce the intended result. An algorithm provides the computer with a set of instructions that it can follow to complete any task. There are three components to an algorithm: sequencing, selection, and iteration. Similar to how you would follow a teacher&#39;s instructions, a sequence is the order in which something should be done in order to accomplish a goal. A loop, or iteration, occurs when something is repeated until a condition is met, such when you turn off your computer after finishing a task. Languages that utilize arithmetic operators include those that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. . Hacks 1 . Sequencing: 1,2,5 Selection: 3 Iteration: 4 . Hacks 2 . num1 = 5 num2 = num1 * 3 num3 = num2 / num1 * (9 % 2) * 4 result = (num3 % num1 + num2) % num3 * 3 / 5 print(result) . 3.0 . Crossword Puzzle . Down: 1) iteration 2) selection . Across: 3) sequence . Hacks 5-6 . Explain in your own words what each logical operator does. . Not: This displays the opposite of the data inputed. | And: This helps determine if the conditions are met | Or: This may help determine if one of the conditions is met. | . Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator . walking = True result = not(walking) print(result) . False . USD = 10 Coins = 100 if USD &gt;= 9 and Coins &gt;= 100: print(&quot;You have a lot of money&quot;) else: print(&quot;you have less money&quot;) . You have a lot of money . Cars = 100 Ferrari = 2 if Ferrari &gt;= 1 or Cars &gt;= 101: print(&quot;you have good cars&quot;) . you have good cars . 1 point for defining all the key terms in your own words. 0.5 points if you use examples that show you truly understand it. . Selection: This is a piece of code that is determined if the ouput is true or false. | Algorithm: An algorithm is a process and a set of rules that should be followed when doing calculations. | Conditional statements: These are a set of rules to see if a condition is met. | . 1 point for writing a program that uses binary conditional logic. 0.5 points if it is original and shows complexity . x = int(input(&quot;choose a number&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(x, &quot;is even&quot;) else: print(x, &quot;is odd&quot;) . 12 is even . Hacks section 9-11 . Notes . First, create algorithms. . Outlining an algorithm&#39;s procedure before coding is a smart idea. This guarantees that it is correctly sequenced. You should use a flowchart or simple language to represent the algorithm. You can use visualization to more clearly observe how the entire algorithm works. This might make the coding process more productive and efficient. . 2) Evaluation of Iteration and Selection . Iterative algorithms repeat a function until a target is reached. We can use iteration to more simply represent an algorithm without illustrating all the repeated steps. Algorithms with selection only execute specific functions in the case of certain conditions being true or false. . 3) Why are algorithms used? . It is simple to think that two algorithms that look quite similar do the same task. That is not the case, though, because we have learned to detect minute variations in code and essentially debug. . isCold = True isHot = False if isCold == True: print(&quot; Jacket necessary!&quot;) elif isHot == True: print(&quot;No Jacket necessary!&quot;) . Jacket necessary! . isCold = False isHot = True puddles = not(isCold) and isHot if isHot == False: print(&quot;No Jacket!&quot;) elif isCold == True: print(&quot;Jacket!&quot;) . 1) When the code first runs, there are 5 coins available. . 2) The AmountMoney variable is set to True. . 3) $1 is subtracted from the coins variable but AmountMoney stays true. . 4) The string &quot;Broke!&quot; is printed when the variable coins reaches a value of 0. At that point, AmountMoney is set to False. . 5) End! . Coins = 10 AmountMoney = True while(AmountMoney == True): Coins -= 1 if Coins == 0: AmountMoney == False print(&quot;Broke&quot;) . Broke .

Lesson 12-13 hacks . a) Procedure: A block of code that is created to perform a given task - essentially a function. . b) Parameter: A variable that is utilized in a function that enables data to be imported into said function. . a) A return value is a value that a function or method returns to the caller code once it has completed executing. Once the function or method has completed its task, the value is returned to the caller code. . b) Output parameters, which are variables supplied by reference to a function or method and used to return a value to the caller code, are another type of parameter. They are frequently used to have a single function or method return a number of values. . import math userNum = float(input()) def sqrt(userNum): return userNum sqrt = math.sqrt(userNum) print(&quot;Square root of&quot;, userNum , &quot;:&quot;, float(sqrt)) .

I will make a thing where if the person gets it wrong i will let the person choose if they want to try again or move onto next question and I will do this with a function try again and next question. Then I will create a variable questions and put all my if statements such as if player clicks correct move to correct screen or if person clicks incorrect go to the incorrect slide. I will get all my images from google. . Review Running example: Something I can do to imporve this program is to tell the person who is taking the quiz if it is incorrect or not instead of the person clicking all the answers to find the right one. Another thing is to create a final page saying that you finished the quiz. quiz Purpose and function The purpose of this quiz is about basketball and asks about the MVP of the year 2022 and few other questions. If you get the question wrong you have the option to retry again or move onto the next question. . Managing Complexity: Some things I did to manage complexity is to plan out everything before I did it and if any error comes up I look through the whole code and try to run it and see how it would run and then I would fix it from there. Another thing is I would ask a partner for help If I am stuck on a problem with my code. I would also check all my functions and see if they are correct and my variables match my screen and button or text names. . Problems that occured: Some problems that occured during the process was my not getting the right variable names and like capitlization of the buttons or the screen name so I had to go through everything and look closely at everything and match every screen button and text &quot;Id&quot; into the code. Another problem that occured was that it would not let me see the blocks so i restarted my computer and the code and it worked. Another problem was the thing was stuck in a loop and the question would not move to the next screen so I removed the loop and fixed it from there. .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .
