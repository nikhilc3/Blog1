            "content": "Lesson 3.14.1 . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description | : | :-: seed() | Initialize the random number generator getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range randint() | Returns a random number between the given range choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . For recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur .

Notes: An algorithm is a sequential process that describes a set of instructions that must be followed in a specific order in order to produce the intended result. An algorithm provides the computer with a set of instructions that it can follow to complete any task. There are three components to an algorithm: sequencing, selection, and iteration. Similar to how you would follow a teacher&#39;s instructions, a sequence is the order in which something should be done in order to accomplish a goal. A loop, or iteration, occurs when something is repeated until a condition is met, such when you turn off your computer after finishing a task. Languages that utilize arithmetic operators include those that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. . Hacks 1 . Sequencing: 1,2,5 Selection: 3 Iteration: 4 . Hacks 2 . num1 = 5 num2 = num1 * 3 num3 = num2 / num1 * (9 % 2) * 4 result = (num3 % num1 + num2) % num3 * 3 / 5 print(result) . 3.0 . Crossword Puzzle . Down: 1) iteration 2) selection .

Hacks section 9-11 . Notes . First, create algorithms. . Outlining an algorithm&#39;s procedure before coding is a smart idea. This guarantees that it is correctly sequenced. You should use a flowchart or simple language to represent the algorithm. You can use visualization to more clearly observe how the entire algorithm works. This might make the coding process more productive and efficient. . 2) Evaluation of Iteration and Selection . Iterative algorithms repeat a function until a target is reached. We can use iteration to more simply represent an algorithm without illustrating all the repeated steps. Algorithms with selection only execute specific functions in the case of certain conditions being true or false. . 3) Why are algorithms used? . It is simple to think that two algorithms that look quite similar do the same task. That is not the case, though, because we have learned to detect minute variations in code and essentially debug. . isCold = True isHot = False if isCold == True: print(&quot; Jacket necessary!&quot;) elif isHot == True: print(&quot;No Jacket necessary!&quot;) . Jacket necessary! . isCold = False isHot = True puddles = not(isCold) and isHot if isHot == False: print(&quot;No Jacket!&quot;) elif isCold == True: print(&quot;Jacket!&quot;) . 1) When the code first runs, there are 5 coins available. . 2) The AmountMoney variable is set to True. . 3) $1 is subtracted from the coins variable but AmountMoney stays true. . 4) The string &quot;Broke!&quot; is printed when the variable coins reaches a value of 0. At that point, AmountMoney is set to False. . 5) End! . Coins = 10 AmountMoney = True while(AmountMoney == True): Coins -= 1 if Coins == 0: AmountMoney == False print(&quot;Broke&quot;) . Broke .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

It is exactly like a factorial . def example_recursive(x): x = int(x) if x &lt; 10: x += 1 x=example_recursive(x) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) return x def example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN): #dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] = int(dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) print(&#39;inside example_recursive_dict, val is: &#39;,dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) if dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] &lt; NN: dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_obj[&#39;sum&#39;] += dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] #print(&#39;inside if&#39;) example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) #recursive_var = input(&quot;What number should we start with?&quot;) #recursive_var=example_recursive(recursive_var) #print(recursive_var) def example_by_reference(dict_obj): dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_test = {&#39;val&#39;: 2, &#39;sum&#39;: 0} print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) dict_test[&#39;val&#39;] = 0 dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;] = 0 example_recursive_dict(dict_test, 5) print(&#39;summation is done, value is: &#39;, dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;]) . 2 3 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 0 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 1 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 2 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 3 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 5 End of recursive loop summation is done, value is: 15 .",

            "content": "Design of the quiz : I am planning the design to be about basketball and the three questions are going to be about the MVP in basketball and how stephen curry looks like and the best player on the Lakers at this momment who did the best overall. I will make a thing where if the person gets it wrong i will let the person choose if they want to try again or move onto next question and I will do this with a function try again and next question. Then I will create a variable questions and put all my if statements such as if player clicks correct move to correct screen or if person clicks incorrect go to the incorrect slide. I will get all my images from google. . Review Running example: Something I can do to imporve this program is to tell the person who is taking the quiz if it is incorrect or not instead of the person clicking all the answers to find the right one. Another thing is to create a final page saying that you finished the quiz. quiz Purpose and function The purpose of this quiz is about basketball and asks about the MVP of the year 2022 and few other questions. If you get the question wrong you have the option to retry again or move onto the next question. . Managing Complexity: Some things I did to manage complexity is to plan out everything before I did it and if any error comes up I look through the whole code and try to run it and see how it would run and then I would fix it from there. Another thing is I would ask a partner for help If I am stuck on a problem with my code. I would also check all my functions and see if they are correct and my variables match my screen and button or text names. . Problems that occured: Some problems that occured during the process was my not getting the right variable names and like capitlization of the buttons or the screen name so I had to go through everything and look closely at everything and match every screen button and text &quot;Id&quot; into the code. Another problem that occured was that it would not let me see the blocks so i restarted my computer and the code and it worked. Another problem was the thing was stuck in a loop and the question would not move to the next screen so I removed the loop and fixed it from there. .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .
